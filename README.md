# Sharding_White_Paper

Sharding in Oracle is a database architecture that allows data to be horizontally partitioned across multiple databases or "shards." Each shard holds a subset of the data, and together they form a sharded database system that can scale out to handle large volumes of data and high transaction rates. Sharding is useful for applications that require high availability, low latency, and massive scalability.

**Key Features of Oracle Sharding:**

**Horizontal Partitioning:** Data is divided across multiple shards based on a sharding key, which is often a unique identifier like a customer ID or geographic location.

**Independent Shards:** Each shard is a fully independent Oracle database. This allows for high availability and disaster recovery, as failures in one shard do not impact others.

**Linear Scalability:** As the demand increases, additional shards can be added to the system to distribute the load without requiring downtime.

**Geographically Distributed:** Shards can be located in different data centers across the globe, improving data locality and reducing latency for end users.

**High Availability and Disaster Recovery:** Oracle Sharding supports replication, ensuring data is duplicated across multiple locations, and provides seamless failover in case of an outage.

**Centralized Management:** Even though the data is distributed across multiple shards, Oracle provides tools for centralized management, monitoring, and querying of the entire sharded database system.

**Use Cases:**

**Global Applications:** Applications serving a global user base, where data needs to be localized to reduce latency.
**Large-Scale Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)**: Systems requiring high transaction throughput.
**Big Data Applications:** Environments where large volumes of data need to be processed and stored across distributed databases.
